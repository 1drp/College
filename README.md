Projects from my college C++ series in 2006/2007

This code was all from my C++ series at Walla Walla University. I had previously taken a C++ course in high school, but do not have any files from those days.

All files were taken from my old MacBook Pro. Some code was written between both this computer and my Windows desktop, but any Windows files have since been lost. With that in mind, some code will be incomplete and/or incorrect.  I am also missing any programs that were written exclusively on my Windows machine.
